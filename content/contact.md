## Meeting me
Since I’m living in Hanoi, personal meetings will most likely be limited to Hanoi and the surrounding towns and villages. Meetings within this area can be arranged quite spontaneously should the situation require it. In order to arrange a meeting with me, please refer to my email address or phone number.

## Email address
You can contact me via my email address:

minh0bon9 [at] gmail [dot] com

### Phone number
Please understand, that I will only give my phone number to people I will meet or have met already. Especially if you’re not living in Vietnam, the phone number might be useless to you anyway.
